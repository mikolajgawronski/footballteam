Recruitment task done for [FootballTeam Game](https://footballteamgame.com/)

It's a simple card game where you pick cards, and so does the opponent. After 5 rounds, the player with most points wins.

This is just the backend part of the game. The frontend part was provided another repo.

Backend is contenerized with Docker. To run it, you need to have Docker installed on your machine.
